# ocarina-of-time
This is the source code for my interactive [Ocarina of Time](https://whiteplums.github.io/ocarina-of-time/index.html) originally made for my ART22 class.

## Features
- Interactive ocarina that plays the same five notes as the ocarina from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Arrow
keys and the letter 'a' are used to play the ocarina which lights up corresponding to what key is pressed.
- Players can play their own songs or play Ocarina of Time songs which trigger special events based off of the video game.

## Credits
- Many thanks to Mengyu for suggesting the keyrecorder idea, SÃ¶len for improving my keypress functions, and Lawrence for showing me the basics of Adobe Illustrator
- Sound effects from http://noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/
