# Interactive Ocarina
This is a Zelda-inspired interactive ocarina made with the p5 library. Do you know any Zelda songs? See what happens when you play one! Play the ocarina [here](https://cartochien.github.io/interactive_ocarina/).

The ocarina currently only works on the web. It is my eventual goal to have it be mobile-friendly as well.
